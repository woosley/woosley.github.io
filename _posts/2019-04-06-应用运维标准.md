最近的工作是带一个SRE 团队，打造公司的基础架构平台，并将公司大大小小的各种系统
迁移到云上面去，在这个过程中，为了使各种应用能够顺利上云，并且按照高标准的要求
开发运维，我们提出了在上线前的如下标准，包括开发，运维和流程等方面，在这里记录
一下

- Commit your code to central git repo as often as possible 
- Protect master branch, only leader have master permission, developers uses dev and feature branch to do development.
- Create code review machanism, any code has to be reviewed before it is merged to master
- Setup automated CI, use this CI process to check the quality of each commit.
- Load balance the all services to avoid single point of failure
- Put different services on different VM sets
- Enforce end to end https encription for external services
- Design stateless services so that is can be load balanced via round robin mechanism 
- Use cloud offered PaaS service, eg RDS, instead of self setup.
- Use dev/qa/prd environment for testing and release pipeline
- Use immutable build to ensure the same package is promoted from QA to production environment.
- Setup continues deployment pipeline with no downtime deployment capability
- Decouple computer resource and storage resource, put application files and data in to data disk
- Run the application with a service account on the OS.
- Setup automated startup & shutdown.
- Log-rotate service logs If it writes on disk logs.
- Integrate with SystemD,  so that the application can be treat as an OS service and managed by systemctl 
- Use automated continus deployment method to do OS configuration and application setup
- Send application logs to a centerlized logging server
- Format your log with a perdefined fomat
- Integate your log with a search engine and dashboard solution
- Provide standard health API 
- Integate the health API with monitoring solution 
- Send VM metrics to a standard time serial database and dashboard solution
- Send cloud PaaS metrics to a time serial database and dashboard solution
- Send application metrics to a time serial database
- Setup VM alerts based on VM metrics
- Setup cloud PaaS service alerting based
- Setup application health alert
- Setup application KPI/API alerts based on application metrics
- Setup 24 * 7 alerting
- Setup VM Performance Metrics Dashboard 
- Setup Application Performance Dashboard
- Setup Application KPI/API Dashboard
- Setup backup for application VM if neccessary
- Setup backup solution for application data 
- Setup application own SLA
- Setup application change process
- Setup application incident process
- Setup application operational scorecard
- Understand Platform & Cloud support policy and SLA
